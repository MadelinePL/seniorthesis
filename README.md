Shell Files:
These files contain shell script that was run on my terminal. These scripts used the XSL stylesheets to extract the data from Jean Paul Rehr's XML files and output the data into TSV files. 

XSL Stylesheets:
These files were used to structure and extract the data from the XML. 

CSV Files:
After the data was output into TSV files, I converted the TSV files into CSV files.

XLSX Files:
In addition to converting the TSV files into CSV files, I also converted the TSV files into XLSX files in order to work with the data using Microsoft Excel features. 

SQL Files:
There were instances where I queried my data using SQL, which required me to copy the data into SQL databases. This folder is also where I will save copies of the SQL queries I ran. 

Misc.:
All other documents I created during the course of this project go here.
